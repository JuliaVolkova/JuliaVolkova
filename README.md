# About me üë©‚Äçüíª

Hello! My name is Julia, and I am a frontend developer with over 7 years of experience. My primary stack is **React** and **TypeScript**, and I am passionate about creating user interfaces. I enjoy being close to the users and directly impacting their experience by building intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Creating exceptional UIs requires diverse knowledge, from design principles and user experience to performance optimization and understanding network and browser specifics. The rapid evolution of the web platform continues to be a constant source of inspiration for me.

## Work Experience

### Development and DevOps
I believe that adopting DevOps practices is crucial in a developer's work. One of the first teams I worked with was an infrastructure team responsible for developing CI/CD processes, managing services, and working with cloud providers. We built a platform for quickly setting up complete or partial production copies for development and testing. This experience sparked my deep interest in DevOps practices, and I have since gained experience implementing e2e testing, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and working with GitLab and TeamCity.

### Leadership and Process Organization
I am convinced that well-established processes within and between teams are essential for successful development. I have always focused on this aspect, taking the initiative to organize and optimize team workflows. In one of my recent companies, I led a frontend development team for a year and a half, managing everything from creating candidate requirements and onboarding new team members to building and implementing efficient development processes.

### Educational Activities
Over the past few years, I have been actively engaged in mentoring. I worked on two educational platforms, guiding student groups in JavaScript and React courses. My responsibilities included giving lectures, conducting code reviews and feedback sessions, assisting students with the curriculum, curating learning materials, and organizing additional activities such as workshops and public interviews. Also, I write articles for Habr ‚Äî for example, [–ú–µ–≥–∞–≥–∞–π–¥: –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã —Å Git](https://habr.com/ru/companies/yandex_praktikum/articles/812139/).

## Community Involvement
I founded a professional developer community in Tbilisi called [Tbilisi JS](https://t.me/tbilisi_js) ü§ü. We actively communicate, share experiences, and organize meetups and conferences. On June 1st, I organized our community‚Äôs first conference, which became a significant event for everyone involved. Here are our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/tbilisi_js_chat) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TbilisiJS).
