# About me üë©‚Äçüíª

Hello! My name is Julia, and I am a frontend developer with over 7 years of experience. My primary stack is **React** and **TypeScript**, and I am passionate about creating user interfaces. I enjoy being close to the users and directly impacting their experience by building intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Creating exceptional UIs requires diverse knowledge, from design principles and user experience to performance optimization and understanding network and browser specifics. The rapid evolution of the web platform continues to be a constant source of inspiration for me.

## Work Experience

I work at Hyperskill as a frontend expert. I collaborate with LX designers, content managers, and authors to review the existing program and design a market-aligned educational roadmap for frontend/full-stack program students.

### Educational Activities
Over the past few years, I have been actively engaged in mentoring. I worked on two educational platforms, guiding student groups in JavaScript and React courses. 
Also, sometimes I write articles or make translations:
- [–ú–µ–≥–∞–≥–∞–π–¥: –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—ã —Å Git](https://habr.com/ru/companies/yandex_praktikum/articles/812139/);

## Community Involvement
I founded a professional developer community in Tbilisi called [Tbilisi JS](https://t.me/tbilisi_js) ü§ü. We actively communicate, share experiences, and organize meetups and conferences. On June 1st, I organized our community‚Äôs first conference, which became a significant event for everyone involved. Here are our [Telegram chat](https://t.me/tbilisi_js_chat) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TbilisiJS).
